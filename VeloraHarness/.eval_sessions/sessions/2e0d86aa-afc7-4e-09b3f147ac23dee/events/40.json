These failures are not directly related to the UNNEST issue described in the problem statement, as the reproduction script for the UNNEST issue did not produce any errors.\\n\\nThe failures seem to be related to the simplification of date arithmetic expressions, where the expected output does not match the actual output. This suggests that there might be an issue with how date arithmetic is being handled or simplified in the optimizer.\\n\\nNext steps:\\n1. Investigate the date arithmetic handling in the optimizer to identify the root cause of these test failures.\\n2. Determine if these failures are related to recent changes or if they are pre-existing issues.\\n3. If necessary, make adjustments to the optimizer to correctly handle date arithmetic.\\n4. Rerun the tests to confirm that the changes resolve the failures.\\n5. Document the findings and confirm with the user if these issues are within the scope of the current task or if they need to be addressed separately.\"}", "name": "think"}, "id": "call_HXAkNTRefRuAZZqEGELlUcgk", "type": "function"}], "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 227, "prompt_tokens": 23269, "total_tokens": 23496, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 17152, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}, "total_calls_in_response": 1}, "content": "Your thought has been logged.", "extras": {}}
