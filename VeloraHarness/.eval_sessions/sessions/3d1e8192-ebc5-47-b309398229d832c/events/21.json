The issue asks for tests covering:\\n1. Cell types from a specific CellxGene link + `blood_and_immune_upper_slim`\\n2. Cell types from another CellxGene link + contextual enrichment\\n\\nI need to fetch the cell types from the provided links. The tool `fetch` can be used for this if the link returns HTML content that lists cell types.\\n\\nThe issue description provides links to cellxgene.cziscience.com.\\n\\nLink 1: https://cellxgene.cziscience.com/e/21d3e683-80a4-4d9b-bc89-ebb2df513dde.cxg/\\nLink 2: https://cellxgene.cziscience.com/e/0b75c598-0893-4216-afe8-5414cab7739d.cxg/\\n\\nThese look like explorer links. I might not be able to \\\"fetch\\\" the cell types directly from the HTML if it's a SPA (Single Page Application).\\n\\nHowever, I can try to see what `fetch` gives me.\\n\\nBut first, I'll create a reproduction script structure. I'll need to define the cell types manually if I can't fetch them, or maybe I can guess them or use a placeholder list if the exact list isn't crucial for *reproducing* an error (though the issue asks to implement tests, implying I should probably use the specific cell types if possible, or maybe the issue implies that `pandasaurus` should be able to handle these specific cases).\\n\\nWait, the issue says \\\"Implement tests using these Test cases\\\". It doesn't explicitly say there is a bug, but \\\"reproduce the error\\\" in the instructions suggests there might be one, or maybe it's just a request to add these scenarios as tests/examples.\\n\\nLet's assume I need to create a script that uses `Query` with these inputs.\\n\\nI will try to fetch the first URL to see if I can get any info.\\n\"}", "name": "think"}, "id": "toolu_07", "type": "function"}], "function_call": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 493, "prompt_tokens": 13352, "total_tokens": 13845, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 8146, "text_tokens": 5206, "image_tokens": null}}, "vertex_ai_grounding_metadata": [], "vertex_ai_url_context_metadata": [], "vertex_ai_safety_results": [], "vertex_ai_citation_metadata": []}, "total_calls_in_response": 1}, "content": "Your thought has been logged.", "extras": {}}
