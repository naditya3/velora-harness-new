The functions `unnest` and `decorrelate` are responsible for transforming SQL expressions involving subqueries into joins. However, the current logic seems to focus on predicates like `IN`, `ANY`, and `EXISTS`, and does not explicitly handle the `UNNEST` function.\\n\\nTo address the issue, I need to:\\n1. Investigate how the `UNNEST` function is currently being parsed and optimized.\\n2. Modify the logic to correctly handle `UNNEST` within CTEs, ensuring that it recognizes and processes the `UNNEST` function appropriately.\\n3. Test the changes to confirm that the issue is resolved.\\n\\nI will now explore the parser and expressions components to understand how `UNNEST` is currently being handled.\"}", "name": "think"}, "id": "call_oJo77JeGxkCXVtdkBnc7FEm1", "type": "function"}], "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 206, "prompt_tokens": 15717, "total_tokens": 15923, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 13184, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}, "total_calls_in_response": 1}, "content": "Your thought has been logged.", "extras": {}}
