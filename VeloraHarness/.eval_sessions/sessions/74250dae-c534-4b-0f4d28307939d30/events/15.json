Since I have `fetch` tool, I can try to see if I can get some info from the URLs. But these are `.cxg` datasets. I likely cannot read them directly with `fetch` if they are binary or complex app endpoints. However, the issue seems to imply using the `pandasaurus` library to perform enrichment on a list of cell types (likely CL terms) derived from those datasets.\n\nWait, the issue says \"Implement tests using these Test cases\". It might mean I need to construct a test that USES these scenarios. I probably need to manually find the list of cell types if I can, or maybe the user provided them? No, the user provided URLs.\n\nLet's see if I can get the list of cell types from the URL or if I should assume some sample cell types.
